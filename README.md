# Passenger Inquiry Insights & Recommendations

This project provides an analysis of **customer inquiries** collected during my duties as a **security officer at Iarnród Éireann**.  
Through daily interactions with passengers, important questions related to service delivery and customer satisfaction were gathered, while intentionally excluding security-specific issues.  

The aim is to **identify frequent causes of dissatisfaction** and propose **practical recommendations** to improve the passenger experience.

## Recommendations  

### 1. Upgraded Station Displays  
- Larger, high-visibility screens on platforms.  
- Show contextual delay info: 
  - Instead of just “2 min”, **“Delayed +2 | Train approaching from Pearse”**.  
- **Moderate complexity**, higher cost (hardware & data integration).  


### 2. Enhanced Irish Rail App & QR Code Integration (Chosen)  
- Place **QR codes** across stations linking to:  
  - Real-time train updates  
  - Platform numbers & directions  
  - Interactive/static station maps  
- Aligned with **20–45 age group**, who are heavy smartphone users.  
- **Low cost, easy to implement, high impact**.  


### 3. Improved Physical Signage  
- Larger, high-contrast signs with simple labels.  
- Universally accessible (incl. tourists & non-smartphone users).  
- **Low cost**.  


## Final Recommendation: QR Code + App Enhancement  
Chosen for its **best balance** between **impact, cost and practicality**.  

### Implementation Steps  
1. **App/Website Enhancement**  
   - Integrate real-time delay data, alerts and clear station maps.  
2. **QR Code Deployment**  
   - Install at entrances, validators and seating areas.  
3. **Awareness Campaign**  
   - Posters, on-screen messages, digital banners.  
4. **Feedback Loop**  
   - In-app prompts & surveys for continuous improvement.  


## Tools Used  
- Data collected manually and stored in **Excel**  
- Categorization & analysis in **Excel / Power BI** (for visualization)
